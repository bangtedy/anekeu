  abstract = {Statistical Inference via Data Science: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse provides a pathway for learning about statistical inference using data science tools widely used in industry, academia, and government. It introduces the tidyverse suite of R packages, including the ggplot2 package for data visualization, and the dplyr package for data wrangling. After equipping readers with just enough of these data science tools to perform effective exploratory data analyses, the book covers traditional introductory statistics topics like confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and multiple regression modeling, while focusing on visualization throughout. Features: \ding{108} Assumes minimal prerequisites, notably, no prior calculus nor coding experience \ding{108} Motivates theory using real-world data, including all domestic flights leaving New York City in 2013, the Gapminder project, and the data journalism website, FiveThirtyEight.com \ding{108} Centers on simulation-based approaches to statistical inference rather than mathematical formulas \ding{108} Uses the infer package for "tidy" and transparent statistical inference to construct confidence intervals and conduct hypothesis tests via the bootstrap and permutation methods \ding{108} Provides all code and output embedded directly in the text; also available in the online version at moderndive.com This book is intended for individuals who would like to simultaneously start developing their data science toolbox and start learning about the inferential and modeling tools used in much of modern-day research. The book can be used in methods and data science courses and first courses in statistics, at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.},

This book introduces you to R, RStudio, and the tidyverse, a collection of R packages designed to work together to make data science fast, fluent, and fun. Suitable for readers with no previous programming experience, R for Data Science is designed to get you doing data science as quickly as possible. Authors Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund guide you through the steps of importing, wrangling, exploring, and modeling your data and communicating the results. You'll get a complete, big-picture understanding of the data science cycle, along with basic tools you need to manage the details. Each section of the book is paired with exercises to help you practice what you've learned along the way. You'll learn how to:  Wrangle--transform your datasets into a form convenient for analysis Program--learn powerful R tools for solving data problems with greater clarity and ease Explore--examine your data, generate hypotheses, and quickly test them Model--provide a low-dimensional summary that captures true "signals" in your dataset Communicate--learn R Markdown for integrating prose, code, and results},
